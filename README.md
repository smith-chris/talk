```json
  {
    "key": "cmd+alt+left",
    "command": "workbench.action.previousEditor"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+alt+right",
    "command": "workbench.action.nextEditor"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+q",
    "command": "quokka.toggle",
    "when": "editorTextFocus"
  },
```

Move quickly through the slides with
- `Cmd + Alt + LeftArrow` → _View: Open Previous Editor_  
- `Cmd + Alt + RightArrow` → _View: Open Next Editor_

Run TypeScript slides with
- `Cmd + Shift + Q` → _Quokka.js: Toggle (Start/Stop) on Current File_

Minimize distractions and maximize screen space 
- `Cmd + B` → _(built-in) View: Toggle Side Bar Visibility_

Use regions to hide imports and code pasted from previous slides
